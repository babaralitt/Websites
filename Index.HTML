    </h1>
    <div class="container pt-5 reveal2">
        <p class="P-ditls">Kirthar National Park, a vast rugged national park in the south-west of Sindh, is home to
            historic Ranikot
            fort. This dry arid land of seemingly endless landscapes of desert with rugged lines of hilly terrain,
            parallel rock hills, and twisted, stony valleys is ranked among the largest national parks of
            <u>Pakistan</u> and
            is home to a wide range of mammals, birds and reptile species.

            Kirthar Park offers a unique and incredible landscape rich in natural beauty and cultural heritage.
            Situated in the Kirthar Mountain Range, Kirthar National Park with an area of over 3,087 km² (about 1200
            mi²), is home to two wildlife sanctuaries — Hub Dam Wildlife Sanctuary and Mahal Kohistan Wildlife Sanctuary
            — and to the Surjan, Sumbak, Eri and Hothiano game reserves.

            Before the independence of <u>Pakistan</u> in 1947, this part of the Kirthar mountain range was used for
            hunting,
            but after research was conducted by the Forest Department in 1965, it was declared a game reserve in 1970.
            Later in 1972, it was declared a wildlife sanctuary, and in 1974, it finally gained its National Park
            status, and was also the first <u>Pakistan</u> park to be included in the United Nations' list of national
            parks
            around the world, in 1975. It is classified by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as a
            Category II area.

            Flora and fauna
            Kirthar National Park is home to a variety of wildlife and the extensive mountainous terrain is an important
            refuge. The last leopard was shot in 1977, and although exact numbers are unavailable, its official status
            is "threatened". Populations of the striped hyena and desert wolf are also feared to have disappeared
            entirely. The desert lynx is critically threatened too. Nonetheless, many species still find their habitat
            here. Indian foxes, jungle cats and jackals are still common. Substantial populations of urials (a type of
            wild sheep), Sindh ibex (also known as Turkman wild goats) and chinkara gazelles live in the park. Indian
            grey mongooses, hedgehogs and porcupine are among the other larger species. In 1984, a captive breeding
            programme for blackbuck was initiated, with the intent to reintroduce them into the wild. Fifteen of these
            antelopes were brought to one of the visitors' centres from the United States for this purpose.

                        <p class="card-text">Leporidae (/ləˈpɔːrɪdiː, -daɪ/) is the family of rabbits and hares,
                            containing over 70 species of extant mammals in all. The Latin word Leporidae means "those
                            that resemble lepus" (hare). Together with the pikas, the Leporidae constitute the mammalian
                            order Lagomorpha. Leporidae differ from pikas in that they have short, furry tails and
                            elongated ears and hind legs</p>
                        <p class="card-text hd-sh-1">The common name "rabbit" usually applies to all genera in the
                            family except Lepus, while members of Lepus (almost half the species) usually are called
                            hares. Like most common names, however, the distinction does not match current taxonomy
                            completely; jackrabbits are members of Lepus, and members of the genera Pronolagus and
                            Caprolagus sometimes are called hares</p>

                            of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and
                            paws, a long tail, and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally
                            classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland
                            Asian tigers and island tigers of the Sunda Islands</p>

                        <p class="card-text hd-sh-2">Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from
                            coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast
                            China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and
                            Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates such as deer and
                            wild boar, which it takes by ambush.</p>

                            the mainland Asian tiger. It is reported in the wild from time to time in the Indian states
                            of Madhya Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, in the Sunderbans region and
                            especially in the former State of Rewa.[1] It has the typical black stripes of a tiger, but
                            its coat is otherwise white or near-white, and it has blue eyes.</p>

                        <p class="card-text hd-sh-3">The white Bengal tigers are distinctive due to the color of their
                            fur. The white fur is caused by a lack which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color
                            fur. When compared to Bengal tigers, the white Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and become
                            heavier than the orange Bengal tiger. They somewhat bigger at birth, and as fully grown
                            adults. White Bengal tigers are fully grown when they are 2–3 years of age.</p>

                            strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of
                            smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular
                            predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,
                            growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too
                            high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and
                            perceives pheromones.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family
                            Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller and shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are
                            members of the same family. Divided among several subfamilies, they are a form taxon; they
                            do not represent a monophyletic group the group of all descendants of a single common
                            ancestral . Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea
                            water.</p>

                        <p class="card-text hd-sh-6">The word duck comes from Old English dūce 'diver', a derivative of
                            the verb *dūcan 'to duck, bend down low as if to get under something, or dive', because of
                            the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending; compare with Dutch duiken
                            and German tauchen 'to dive'.

                            This word replaced Old English ened /ænid 'duck', possibly to avoid confusion with other
                            words, such as ende 'end' with similar forms. Other Germanic languages still have similar
                            words for duck, for example, Dutch eend, German Ente and Norwegian and. </p>

                <p class="mt-4 P-ditls">The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply
                    panda,
                    is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its black-and-white coat and rotund body.
                    The name "giant panda" is used to distinguish it from the distantly related red panda. Adult
                    individuals average 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb), and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6
                    ft 3 in) long. The species is sexually dimorphic, as males are typically 10 to 20% larger. The fur
                    is white, with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. A thumb is visible on the
                    bear's forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. Giant pandas have adapted larger
                    molars and expanded temporal fossa to meet their dietary requirements.

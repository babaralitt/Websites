        <h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center  bg-warning">Team Bio</h1>
        <p class="P-ditls">In 1865 a group of shinty players met at the Clinton Arms on Nottingham's Shakespeare Street.
            J. S. Scrimshaw's proposal to play football instead was agreed and Nottingham Forest Football Club was
            formed. It was agreed at the same meeting that the club would purchase twelve tasselled caps coloured
            'Garibaldi Red' (named after the leader of the Italian 'Redshirts' freedom fighters). Thus the club's
            official colours were established. Forest's first ever official game was played against Notts County taking
            place on 22 March 1866.[1]
            <br>

            In their early years Forest were a multi-sports club. As well as their roots in bandy and shinty, Forest's
            baseball club were British champions in 1899.[2] Forest's charitable approach helped clubs like Liverpool,
            Arsenal and Brighton & Hove Albion to form. In 1886, Forest donated a set of football kits to help Arsenal
            establish themselves – the then South London team still wear red. Forest also donated shirts to Everton and
            helped secure a site to play on for Brighton.
            <br>
            The 1898 Cup-winning squad
            In 1878–79 season Forest entered the FA Cup for the first time. Forest beat Notts County 3–1 in the first
            round at Beeston Cricket Ground before eventually losing 2–1 to Old Etonians in the semi-fina
            Forest led the First Division for most of the 1977–78 season and were confirmed as 1977–78 Football League
            champions after a 0–0 draw against Coventry City on 22 April 1978, seven points ahead of runners-up
            Liverpool. Forest became one of the few teams (and the most recent team to date) to win the First Division
            title the season after winning promotion from the Second Division.[nb 1] This made Clough the third of four
            managers to win the English league championship with two different clubs.[nb 2] Forest lost only three of
            the 42 league games and conceded just 24 goals.[29] Their only other defeat all season was a sixth round FA
            Cup loss against West Bromwich Albion in March.[28] They also beat Liverpool in the 1978 Football League Cup
            Final. The match went to a replay as the game at Wembley finished 0–0. The replay, played at Old Trafford
            four days later, was decided by a John Robertson penalty, giving Forest a 1–0 win. Forest had been without
            cup-tied Shilton, Gemmill and December signing David Needham.[32] 18-year-old goalkeeper Chris Woods played
            in both matches in Shilton's absence. McGovern missed the replay through injury meaning Burns lifted the
            trophy as deputising captain.[22][33] Burns was voted FWA Footballer of the Year and Shilton won the PFA
            Players' Player of the Year award.
            <br>
            Forest started the 1978–79 season by beating Ipswich Town 5–0 in the FA Charity Shield, a record win in the
            competition.[10] On 9 December 1978 Liverpool ended Forest's 42 match unbeaten league run dating back to the
            November the year before.[10] The unbeaten run was the equivalent of a whole season, surpassing the previous
            record of 35 games held by Burnley in 1920/21.[34] The record stood until it was surpassed by Arsenal in
            August 2004, a month before Clough's death. Arsenal played 49 league games without defeat.[35] Forest also
            beat Southampton 3–2 at Wembley to retain the League Cup; Birtles scored twice and Woodcock once. Forest
            finished second in the First Division, eight points behind Liverpool. In February 1979 Forest completed the
            English game's first £1 million transfer by signing striker Trevor Francis from Birmingham City.[36]

            In the 1978–79 European Cup, they were drawn to play the winners of the two previous seasons, Liverpool.
            Forest took a 2–0 first leg lead thanks to goals from Birtles and Colin Barrett. A 0–0 draw at Anfield
            ensured that Forest progressed to the next round.[37] Further wins against AEK Athens and Grasshopper Zurich
            took them to the semi-finals, where they were drawn to face German champions 1. FC Köln. In the first leg at
            the City Ground Köln took a surprise 2–0 lead. Forest then bounced back to lead 3–2, before a rare Shilton
            error allowed the Germans to make it 3–3. Due to the away goals rule, this meant that Forest had to win in
            Koln to progress to the final. In the second leg in Germany, Ian Bowyer scored the only goal of the match to
            put Forest through. Günter Netzer asked afterwards, "Who is this McGovern? I have never heard of him, yet he
            ran the game." Forest's opponents in the final at Munich's Olympiastadion were Swedish champions Malmö.
            Francis scored the only goal with a back post header from Robertson's cross. As he had been signed
            mid-season, the final was the first European Cup match that Francis was eligible to play in.
